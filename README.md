```
// Main theme colors 
// Some cool main theme colors(violet:#8476ad;blue:#5cacee;red:#ff7373,#ff6f69;green:#6acf64,#2ddbb3;orange:#ffa268)

$mono-color:#8476ad;                // main theme color(header, links, footer icons, buttons, post-title)
$hl-color: $darkGray;              // header link color (author name and posted on date) for blog post meta 
$navbar-hover-color:$gray;        // navbar hover color (site name and navbar links hover color)
$link-color: $darkerGray;        // normal hyperlink color other than the ones above.


// Heading colors
// You can play around with these too!
$h1-color: $mono-color;
$h2-color: $mono-color; 
$h3-color: $darkerGray; 
$h4-color: $gray;

Finally you need to set up your avatar. Pick up your avatar, resize it to 220x220px simply using paint or any editor of your choice and upload it to the images folder. Now open _variables.scss, you'll see something like this `$avatar: "/images/avatar.jpg";`. Here change the avatar.jpg to what you have uploaded just now.

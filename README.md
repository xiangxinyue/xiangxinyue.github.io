# Building a static website with GitHub Pages 
I am going to write a readme for anyone, including people who don't have a lot of computer foundations. So that people can use GitHub Pages to build their own static websites in a short time. This readme will also include the steps to buy a domain name (if you do want to have your own domain name instead of github.io), resolve the domain name, and so on.

# About
In February of 2019, I came up with the idea of ​​making my own personal website/tech blog. At that time, I was the second year computer major student who was looking for an internship so this website might help me more on that time. Ans also it is the time when I really wanted to learn new knowledge.

# Requirement
1)A github id is enough at the beginning! 
2)If you want to make a better website based on frame you might need to know some basic HTML/CSS/JS. 
3)Overall, it is need Github pages + Jekyll + Ruby + Git +md.

# First Step: Let's Go! Create a Repository
1)Have you github id and know some basic of Git is great.
2)create a new repository named like xiangxinyue.github.io (name.github.io).

# Second Step: Choose a theme or fork other people's repo
1)Go to the setting and find the Github Pages.
2)You will see a link like "Your site is published at https://xiangxinyue.github.io/". Click it and you will see your website.

# Third Step: get your machine enviorment prepared

1)Before you have Jekyll in your machine, you need to have ruby and gem. If you do not have ruby in your machine first install ruby and gem.
2)Use "$ ruby -v" to check your ruby version or if your machine have ruby. Mac OS already have ruby but you better to get a newest one.
3)Use "$ brew install ruby" to download ruby. If you do not have home brew in your machine use the command "$/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
4)Use "$ gem install jekyll bundle" to download jekyll. 
5)You better do the whole things in the Ubuntu, it is better in Mac OS.
6)I wrote another file about "Mac OS download Jekyll".

# Fourth Step: Revise the website to your style using Jekyll
1)Another way to open the website is "cd xiangxinyue.github.io" in terminal. -> then "bundle exec jekyll serve". Then you can go through Returned IP address and to look at your website through localhost.
